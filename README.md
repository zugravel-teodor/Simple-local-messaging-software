# Simple-local-messaging-software
SLMS as the name suggests is a local messaging software to leave password protected messages to your co-workers when your shift ends. (UNSTABLE - TESTERS NEEDED)

### WARNING, the code is really disgusting too look at. It contains lots of logic errors and lots of bugs. The code is also extremelly insecure, using security by obscurity by default which is an extremelly insecure method of protection. All of this will be fixed in the future, this is a just a prototype.
I originally wanted to code this in Python since I am a somewhat good Python programmer but tried to make it in C++ as a challange. Ignore my spelling mistakes.
